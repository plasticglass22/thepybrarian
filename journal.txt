this is, in essence, just a little tool to index/organize/etc. my digital textbook collection. in the beginning, 
the idea was to make a fairly OOP leaning project, but turns out i'm dogsh*t at programming.

so, i'm starting over. i saw this series of youtube videos called "endless to-do app", where a guy builds a to-do 
app piece by piece, feature by feature, basically forever. real "ship of theseus" kind of thing, but with code.

so that's what i'm gonna do. start small, build brick by brick until i have an actual shippable piece of software. 
might even become a better programmer in the process.

    nuke all the old stuff. ignore the old attempts, back to square one.

    task 1:
        list all the files in a directory -> recursively list subdirectories

    getting the cwd is easy enough with the os module. next thing to do is to collect and print the names of objects 
    in the dir. glob.glob() sorta works for this. as is, it is so far just getting files, not subdirs. lemme rtfm for 
    a minute.

    ok, i got glob.glob() to recursively list all the files in CWD. next problem: listing subdirectories on their own 
    line.

    task 2:
        list subdir names as if they were files, then list their contents.
