this is, in essence, just a little tool to index/organize/etc. my digital textbook collection. in the beginning, 
the idea was to make a fairly OOP leaning project, but turns out i'm dogsh*t at programming.

so, i'm starting over. i saw this series of youtube videos called "endless to-do app", where a guy builds a to-do 
app piece by piece, feature by feature, basically forever. real "ship of theseus" kind of thing, but with code.

so that's what i'm gonna do. start small, build brick by brick until i have an actual shippable piece of software. 
might even become a better programmer in the process.
